### A Noite dos Mortos-Físicos

**Resumo:** A noção de vida após a morte tem se mostrado encantadora na cultura pop, e diversos filmes, séries e outras formas de mídia tem utilizado criaturas monstruosas como zumbis e vampiros para contar suas histórias. Em geral, estas envolvem apocalipses causados por uma infecção que faz com que os contaminados morram e retornem à vida de uma maneira profana. Neste seminário, apresentaremos aos alunos ingressantes do IFUSP como é possível utilizar ferramentas físicas, em particular técnicas envolvendo sistemas dinâmicos não-lineares, para descrever a evolução de um apocalipse zumbi e estudar sob quais condições a espécie humana tem chances de prevalecer. Tome cuidado: nas condições certas, uma equação pode ser a diferença entre a vida e a morte.

**Palestrantes:** Níckolas Alves (DFMA-IFUSP), Pedro Henrique Trajano Lemos Tredezini (DFMA-IFUSP) e Patrick Dreger Andriolo (CCM_USP)

**Résumés:** Níckolas ingressou como bacharelando no Instituto de Física da Universidade de São Paulo (IFUSP) em 2017, onde tem desde então organizado alguns eventos de extensão voltados majoritariamente aos estudantes de graduação em Física do Instituto.

### A brave new world from an accelerated point of view: The Unruh effect

**Abstract:** The Unruh effect completed its 40th anniversary in 2016. Briefly, it says that while inertial observers see no particles in what they call the vacuum state of a quantum field, uniformly accelerated observers not only see particles, but see a thermal distribution of them. Although the effect was originally derived in the context of better understanding Hawking radiation, it has given rise to a vast research effort, both theoretical and experimental. In this talk, we give an overview of the Unruh effect: what it is, what it can teach us about quantum field theory, its connections to other topics and some of its applications.

**Speaker:** Gabriel Cozzella, IFT-UNESP

**Résumé:** I have a bachelor's degree in Molecular Sciences (2014, USP), a master's degree in theoretical physics (2016, IFT/UNESP) and currently I'm a PhD candidate at IFT/UNESP under the supervision of Prof. George Matsas. Currently my research deals with quantum field theory in curved spacetimes, focusing mainly on the Unruh effect and its observability.

### Ah, Yes, Enslaved Delta Functions

**Abstract:** Electromagnetism is one of the great areas of classical physics and there are many theoretically interesting results and techniques to be explored in it. In this seminar, following a brief review on basic relativity and electromagnetism, as well as some tensor calculus, I intend to show Green's functions and how they're useful when solving the fundamental equations of electrodynamics.

**Speaker:** Pedro Henrique Trajano Lemos Tredezini, DFMA-IFUSP

### Stand So Close to Me
#### What is the meaning of a limit?

**Abstract:** Topology might be one of the most "family friendly" areas of Mathematics. With lots of outreach material mentioning how doughnuts and mugs are equivalent, it certainly looks appealing, but few people actually know what it is all about. During this seminar, I plan to present a simple introduction to Topology by continuously extending the notion of limits from the real line to general topological spaces. By the end of the seminar, it should be clear why it is important to keep an open mind about such constructions.

**Speaker:** Níckolas Alves, DFMA-IFUSP

**Résumé:** He has started a Bachelor's degree in Physics from the Institute of Physics of the University of São Paulo (IFUSP) in 2017, where he has been organizing some extension events aiming mainly at the undergraduate students.

### What determines the spatial distribution of dark matter halos in the Universe?

**Abstract:** In modern cosmological models, 5/6 of the matter of the Universe is in the form of dark matter. The dark matter collapses to form bound objects called dark matter halos, the building blocks of the large scale structure in which galaxies form and evolve. These halos are not distributed uniformly throughout the Universe. Therefore, a natural question arises: do the properties of dark matter halos affect their clustering? Which of them and how? It is well known that the clustering of the rare, massive halos is enhanced relative to the general mass distribution, an effect known as bias. With numerical simulations, it was shown that massive halos are more strongly clustered than less massive halos; the more massive the halo, the larger the bias. However, halo bias depends on a variety of secondary halo properties other than halo mass, an effect called secondary bias.
In my undergraduate research project, I use the MultiDark cosmological numerical simulations to measure the dependence of halo clustering on spin, concentration and age, and also analyze the evolution of these effects with redshift. This study is expected to shed light upon the physical origins of the secondary bias effect, which can help us understand open questions about the formation and evolution of dark matter halos and galaxies.

**Speaker:** Beatriz Tucci, CCM-USP

I am currently interested in learning and trying to better explain the physics behind the formation and distribution of dark matter halos and how they are connected with galaxies.

### Applications of Conformal Mappings to Two Dimensional Electrostatics

**Abstract:** Many of the problems in Electrostatics involve finding the electric potential satisfying Laplace's Equation and some boundary conditions. Sometimes, this task might be extremely challenging. In this presentation I intend to demonstrate a method using conformal mappings to solve two-dimensional electrostatic problems by solving a simpler problem and mapping it to the original one.

**Remark:** As stated during the seminar, the method is not correctly described in the lecture notes. Do read the references in order to see the correct approach. The very same references have other examples of applications.

### Classical Transport Phenomena: The Elusiveness of the Second Law

**Abstract:** The ideal gas was the first successful statistical mechanics ever devised. It started as the naive study of particles colliding between themselves in very large containers under the hypothesis of thermal equilibrium. The physical laws of classical mechanics governing these motions are, however, completely reversible.
The aim of this lecture is to give some intuition towards how the irreversible nature of the Second Law can be understood as a sequence of informational approximations on a reversible system, giving rise to Boltzmann's famous H-theorem and linear fluid phenomena like heat conduction, diffusion, and viscosity as consequences of the coarse-grained dynamics of a many body system with pairwise interactions.

**Speaker:** Gabriel Golfetti, IFUSP

**Résumé:** I'm an undergraduate sophomore in the Bachelor in Physics at the University of São Paulo.

### Pra Dizer Adeus Ao Office
#### Uma Introdução ao LaTeX

**Resumo:** Já dizia o Piadas Nerds: "Um computador sem Windows é como um bolo de chocolate sem mostarda". A mesma noção pode ser estendida trivialmente a programas de edição de texto como o Word, que sempre se mostrou excelente para o estudo de sistemas caóticos. Afinal de contas, pequenas alterações na posição de uma figura já são capazes de afetar a diagramação do texto como um todo de maneiras completamente inesperadas. E nem me deixe começar a comentar sobre o maravilhoso e prático sistema de inserção de equações.
E se existisse um sistema de criação de documentos simples, que fosse mais prático para a inserção de equações, não cause problemas de diagramação e tenha um resultado elegante e profissional? Certamente você já se fez esta mesma pergunta milhares, talvez até milhões de vezes, e na maioria concluiu que se algo tão maravilhoso existisse, provavelmente custaria muito caro. E talvez nem acredite quando eu contar que existe, é amplamente usado pela Academia e ainda por cima é completamente gratuito.
Nesta apresentação pretendo lhe ensinar os princípios básicos do LaTeX para que possa se despedir de uma vez do Pacote Office e acabar com as dores de cabeça causadas pelo Word ao adicionar uma nova imagem. Não se preocupe: não é nem cedo nem tarde demais para dizer adeus ao Office. É a hora perfeita.

### O Método SPH e suas Aplicações na Fenomenologia de Colisões de Íons Pesados

**Abstract:** No início dos tempos e nos aceledores de partículas: o Plasma de Quarks e Gluons é uma interessante fase da matéria encontrada nas condições mais extremas do universo. Podemos produzi-lo colidindo íons pesados a altíssimas velocidades e o melhor de tudo isso: podemos usar modelagem hidrodinâmica para caracterizar fenomenologicamente essas colisões. Vamos abordar de forma mais simples como são essas colisões e como elas podem ser simuladas computacionamente utilizando modelos hidrodinâmicos e relativísticos através de um método chamado Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics - O SPH.

**Speaker:** Vinícius Silva Franção, DFMA-IFUSP

### Emmy Noether: Life and Science. An Invitation to Celebrate 100 Years of Noether´s Theorems.

**Abstract:** "The world gave her nothing but obstacles. - She gave us one of the most powerful theorems in physics" (Noether circle at the Perimeter Institute).
The Noether´s theorems establish a connection between the two most important ideas in science: conservation laws and symmetries of Nature.
In the first part of the talk we will remember life of Emmy Noether, discussing her life, oficial career and three different periods in the research. After we will review Noether theorems and symmetries and their impact to different areas of physics up to now. The talk is more historical, but in this case history and science are inseparable.

**Speaker:** Profa. Dra. Zhanna Kuznetsova, CMCC-UFABC

**Date:** May 30, 2019

**Remark:** This seminar is going to take place at the Adma Jafet Auditorium.

### Escape (The Electron Song)

**Abstract:** Einstein's 1905 paper "Concerning An Heuristic Point Of View Toward The Emission And Transformation Of Light" earned him the Physics Nobel Prize in 1921 and established one of the first foundations os Quantum Theory. I believe the genius of Einstein's theory can be appreciated by most people with a basic formation in Physics (even at High School level, though elementary undergradute courses are surely welcome) and my main goal at this seminar is to present the photoelectric effect accordingly to this belief. In order to do so, I am going to present Eintein's heuristic arguments when justifying the quantization of light, but employing much more handwaving and much less physical formalism when doing so. I intend to arrive at the expression for the photoelectric stopping potential and show some of the experiments developed by students on usual Experimental Physics undergraduate courses at the Institute of Physics.

### Under Pressure... and Extremely High Temperatures

**Abstract:** When the first atomic nuclei formed, there was only Hydrogen, Helium and traces of Lithium. I’ll try to elucidate how the rest of the periodic table appeared, through a variety of nucleosynthesis processes. From the proton-proton chain to processes that create the heaviest elements found in nature, we’ll discover why we are formed of stellar dust.

**Speaker:** Guilherme de Oliveira Jorge, IFUSP

**Résumé:** Graduated in bachelor’s in physics, just started a License’s degree course, and is interested in cosmology, stellar astrophysics and string theory.

### As Crônicas de Gelo e Água: Uma Introdução às Transições de Fase

**Abstract:** Phase transitions are characterized by abrupt changes in the system that occur when we vary its interaction with a thermal bath. For example, the violent change from ice to steam as we increase its temperature. In this seminar I hope to introduce you to these extraordinary phenomena and some of their fundamental properties.

**Speaker:** Gabriel Lefundes, IFUSP

### And Then We Said: Let There Be Light!

**Abstract:** Constructing physical theories from the ground up is usually quite a daunting task. Choosing equations to describe phenomena typically relies on arbitrarily large sets of experimental data and many hours of educated (or not) guessing to eventually produce results. But what if we went the other way around? In this lecture we shall consider a set of reasonable and relatively weak assumptions. After a few calculations regarding their consequences we will naturally arrive at Maxwell's equations for electrodynamics.

**Speaker:** Gabriel Golfetti, IFUSP

**Résumé:** I'm an undergraduate sophomore in the Bachelor in Physics at the University of São Paulo. Before getting into university, I've been studying physics since my first year of high school preparing for international physics olympiads. I'm an EuPhO 2017 silver medalist and IPhO 2017 gold medalist. I'm interested in theoretical solid state physics, but also enjoy looking into fundamental phenomena and how many postulates we can abandon and still come up with the same physical theories.

**Date:** April 11, 2019

### Quantum Mechanics: A Pedagogical Approach To a Geometric Theory

**Abstract:** Instead of trying to explore the historical side of QM, I will begin with it’s postulates and what is their physical inspiration. Moreover, since QM is a theory formulated on vector spaces, I will emphasize the geometrical aspects and possible analogies with the Euclidean Geometry that new students are studying at the moment.I will try to restrain myself to the systems that can lead to finite dimension eigenproblems, which are easy to follow through.

**Speaker:** Guilherme Dias Vianna, IFT-Unesp

**About me:** I’m a MsC student at IFT-UNESP and an alumnus of IFUSP from the class of 2018. Being a high-school teacher since 2016, I used to think of myself as a “jack of all-trades” (or just a good trickster), but I finally decided to dive into theoretical condensed matter physics as my research area.

**Date:** April 04, 2019

### The Geometry of Spacetime

**Abstract:** The goal of this lecture is to make sense of the statement: space-time is a four dimensional smooth manifold with a Lorentz metric. From manifolds to connections and metrics, we'll have an introduction to pseudo Riemmanian geometry and then derive Einstein's field equations just for fun.

**Speaker:** Thomas Felipe Campos Bastos, IFUSP

**Résumé:** Started a Bachelor's degree in Physics at IFUSP in 2017. He has been advised by Dr. Victor Bernardo Chabu (FMA-IFUSP) since 2018. Mainly interested in Mathematical Physics.

### Topology (and Metrics) for the Young at Heart

**Abstract:** Aside from Set Theory, everyone who aims to work with Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (and, in particular, Mathematical Physics) must at some point learn about Metric Spaces and Topological Spaces, specially due to the use of convergence (like in infinite series) and continuity in abstract spaces. This lecture is aimed for those who already have at least some familiarity with Set Theory, and would like to have a look at the kind of mathematics used in modern theoretical physics and maths.

**Speaker:** Nicholas Funari Voltani, IFUSP

**Résumé:** Graduated from high school in 2014 and began his bachelor's degree in Physics Engineering in the year after. Transferred to a bachelor in Physics in 2017. Interested in Mathematical Physics, particularly in Differential Manifolds.

### Connecting Dots
#### From Hamilton's Principle to Schrödinger's Equation

**Abstract:** Classical Mechanics is a topic everyone's familiar with: we have seen it since High School in it's most basic formulation, and we continue to see it throughout all our carreer, in more advanced forms. Hamilton-Jacobi theory is the pinacle of Classical Mechanics, for it provides us with a powerful method to determine equations of motion, but most importantly, it sets the basis for quantum mechanics.

**Speaker:** Pedro Henrique Trajano Lemos Tredezini, IFUSP

**Résumé:** I'm an undergraduate student in the Bachelor on Physics who joined IFUSP at 2018. I'm interested in theoretical physics.

**Date:** March 14, 2019

### Mathematical Proofs
#### Applications on Physics and Discourse in General

**Abstract:** Mathematical proofs are a fundamental component of modern mathematics, and arguably the most useful one to the layman, but such concepts have been excluded from high school education. In this seminar, I aim to acquaint freshmen with some fundamentals of logic, as well as with some of the most common techniques used in proofs. Subsequently, I will apply the newly acquired tools to math and physics problems as well as comment on and ilustrate its applications on debating topics outside of the scope of the hard sciences.

**Speaker:** Iuri Grangeiro Carvalho, IFUSP

**Résumé:** He graduated from high school in 2015 and started his bachelor's degree in the following year. He is currently being advised by Prof. Rodrigo Bissacot (IME-USP) and takes interest in statistical mechanics under a mathematical physics approach, as well as combinatorics and graph theory.

### From Ebony to Ivory
#### Fourier Transforms and their applications to PDEs

**Abstract:** Like the keys in a piano, time and frequency live together in perfect harmony and relate to each other through Fourier Transforms. In this seminar, aimed at Physics students that are not yet familiar with Partial Differential Equations, I intend to propose the Fourier Transform and show some of its properties, abstaining myself from the mathematical details of the theory. Having all the neccessary tools in the shed, I will use the Fourier Transform to solve some PDEs commonly used through Physics, with some extra attention to Maxwell's Equations.

**Speaker:** Níckolas de Aguiar Alves, IFUSP

Has been advised by Prof. Dr. João Carlos Alves Barata (FMA-IFUSP) since January 2018 and is currently interested in Classical Electrodynamics, specially the search for general solutions for Maxwell's Equations.

**Date:** February 28, 2019

**Remark:** This seminar will happen at Room 2022, due to the registration of freshmen students that will be happening at the Institute

### Representing Symmetry
#### The Dynamics of the Universe

**Abstract:** Special Relativity is one the most thoroughly tested and agreeable theories in all of Physics. Since its originial conception, the physics of the Lorentz group has been studied in many different contexts and interpreted by many great minds, culminating with the representation-theoretic approach given by Dirac in 1928. In this seminar I hope to give a not-too-technical derivation of the Lorentz group and the corresponding Lie algebra based only on postulates of symmetry and causality. Also, I shall be introducing linear representation theory as a means of formulating dynamics of arbitrary complexity that are compatible with the Principle of Relativity.

**Speaker:** Gabriel Golfetti, IFUSP

### Nanoparticles' Nanoworld: a Nanostudy

**Abstract:** Since the nanotechnology became a field of study, in the 80’s, many areas have been developed. From food industry to medicine, the nanotechnology is expanded day by day. In this study, we focus in nano-structures applied to the nano-medicine: a very diverse and essential field to public health care. One of them is the cubosome: a nanoparticle that has a cubic internal structure. The other is the liposome, a spherical bilayered nanoparticle. Both of them are prepared using amphiphilic lipids and are studied to be applied as drug nano-carriers. This would allow drug administration to be more effective and, maybe, cheaper than it is nowadays. But, as a molecule is needed for the study of encapsulation, two were chosen: LINS03017 - incorporated in cubosomes - and an essential oil called cineole - encapsulated in liposomes, both with different applications. Finally, to see what happened with the nanoparticles, some biophysical methods were adopted, such as SAXS (small angle x-ray scattering), TEM (transmission electronic microscopy) and Fluorescence Anisotropy.

**Speaker:** Giovana Firpo de Moraes Rodrigues, IFUSP

**Résumé:** Studying the Bachelor's degree in Physics at the University of São Paulo (USP), and I have a CNPq project in the area of Biophysics, in the field of nanotechnology and drug delivery systems. She is currently being advised by Prof. Dr. Leandro Ramos Souza Barbosa.

### Exploring Fluids and the Continuous Media

**Abstract:** Fluids are a part of physics very important to the study of inumerous phenomena. The concepts of fluids are based on the continous media idea, and we wil try to explore this idea and construct two fundamental equations to the study of hydrodynamics: the continuity equation and the Euler equation of motion of fluids.

**Speaker:** Vinícius Silva Franção, IFUSP

**Résumé:** He started his undergraduate degree on Physics at the Institute of Physics of the University of São Paulo in 2017. Currently, he's enrolled on a research project entitled "Fluid Computational Simulation with SPH Method" under the advisement of Professor Dr. Frederique M. S. Grassi.

**Date:** November 07, 2018

### What is the Cosmos?

**Abstract:** In this seminar, we will discuss about that ancient human question which remains in the heart of modern science: what is the cosmos?
In order to make an attempt to answer it, our approach will be the physical cosmology. Given that, we will recover the physical laws that we have been developing since the very beginning of scientific thinking, and equipped with those tools we will be able to make a brief travel through the cosmos - not only through space, but also through its evolution over time.

**Speaker:** Beatriz Tucci Schiewaldt, CCM-USP

**Résumé:** Beatriz Tucci Schiewaldt is a student of the Molecular Sciences course at USP and an young cosmologist.

**Date:** October 31, 2018

### Women in Exact Sciences

**Abstract:** Professor Márcia Barbosa, a woman physicist from UFRGS, said “There are few women that enter in the exact courses, and there are even fewer that finish it”. However, it is not a new phenomenon. Some historians say that since the brutal death of Hypatia (415 B.C.), women were blocked from studying exact sciences and the ones that had studied were neglected in history. Now, in 2016, a research showed that in the Physics course in USP, the percentual of women who join the course is only 23%, against 77% of men. This difference was more pronounced in Poli-USP, with a percentual of 18% of women. I believe that a large percentage of this lack of women is given by the few representations of women in our classes in basic teaching. So, in this seminar, I will present the history about some women in exact sciences and talk with the audience trying to find a way to include their history in the basic teaching.

**Speaker:** Rodrigo dos Anjos Silva, IFUSP

**Résumé:** Rodrigo dos Anjos Silva entered the Physics Teaching course at IFUSP in 2018. He studied 216 hours of applied mathematics in Prandiano course and now is an intern in a public school in São Paulo (SP).

**Date:** October 24, 2018

### Approximation and Interpolation by Rational Curves
#### and some of its applications in physics

**Abstract:** Throughout an usual undergraduate course in physics, we are exposed to several fairly general results involving curves, that are mainly, Green's Theorem, Stokes' Theorem and the Gradient theorem. Nevertheless, we always restrict ourselves to work with easily parametrized curves, such as, straight lines, circles, ellipses and curves defined by the elementary functions.
However in several physical situations of the real world , we see ourselves with the problem of having to describe a arbitrary curve mathematically, but because this curve is arbitrary, we don't have, in general, an exact form to express it. (Such as through one function with varying paramethers, or with differential equations).
In these conditions, we have as our only resouce the methods of approximation and interpolation, to achieve the mathematical expression that models the sought after curve, whence the motivation to present this seminar is taken.

**Speaker:** Felipe Dilho Alves, IFUSP

**Résumé:** Undergraduate physics student at the Institute of Physics of the University of São Paulo (IFUSP) since 2016. Started a scientific initiation project, with title Introduction to the Mathematical Methods of Theoretical Physics, advised by Prof. Dr. João Carlos Alves Barata (FMA-IFUSP), having changed since then to another scientific initiation project, in Semiclassical Analysis and its Physical Applications with Postdoctoral researcher Victor Bernardo Chabu.

**Date:** October 10, 2018

### As Time Goes By
#### Seeking a Solution to Maxwell's Equations

**Abstract:** The power of the potential formulation of Electro and Magnetostatics is widely known by Physics students. The simplicity of calculating a scalar field instead of a vector one is a great weapon in a physicist's arsenal (and it is likely to make tests a lot easier). In this talk, I shall explore the potential formulation of Electrodynamics, departing from static scalar and vector potentials and walking towards the potential expressions of electromagnetic fields in dynamical cases. Using the Lorenz gauge, I intend to find the retarded potentials and Jefimenko's Equations - the general form of Coulomb and Biot-Savart Laws as time goes by - to solve Maxwell's Equations once and for all.
