### Python for Data Analysis in Experimental Physics

**Abstract:** Declare your freedom from the softwares used for experimental physics data analysis. Many undergrads are completely dependent on softwares that can limit their analysis, and Python is way more flexible and complete to any purpose. You'll be introduced to the main libraries and methods for data analysis with focus on experimental physics and then you'll finally be capable of fitting a model. Nowadays one of the most common and finest approaches to data analysis is Python and it's libraries. Hence, this seminar is a must to everyone interested in data science and computational approach to physics.

**Speaker:** Rodrigo da Motta, IFUSP and IFGW

**Résumé:** Physics undergrad at University of São Paulo (USP). Interested in Statistical Physics, Neuroscience and Data Science. Currently being advised by Rickson C. Mesquita on Computational Neuroscience.

**Date:** April 08, 2021

### Statistical Quantum Correlations in Many-Particle Systems

**Abstract:** To be announced

**Speaker:** [Vinícius Silva Franção](http://lattes.cnpq.br/2740065021564950), DFMA-IFUSP

**Résumé:** To be announced

**Date:** April 22, 2021

**Remark:** This seminar will happen at 16h30 BRT instead of the usual 14h00 BRT


### Physics of Societies

**Abstract:** We will present the paper [Consensus Formation Times in Anisotropic Societies](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.95.062305), in which Juan Neirotti developed a statistical mechanics model to study the emergence of a consensus in societies of adapting, interacting agents constrained by a social rule B. In the mean-field approximation, we find that if the agents' interaction H0 is weak, all agents adapt to the social rule B, with which they form a consensus; however, if
the interaction is sufficiently strong, a consensus is built against the established status quo.

**Speaker:** [José Arthur de Toledo Queiroz](http://lattes.cnpq.br/5246038593368301), CCM-USP and DFGE-IFUSP

**Résumé:** Currently he is an undergraduate student in Molecular Sciences at University of São Paulo (USP) with major in Physics. He is interested in Theoretical Physics, particularly in Neural Networks, Statistical Mechanics and Information Theory, being advised by Prof. Nestor Caticha (DFGE-IFUSP) on the topic.

**Date:** To be announced
