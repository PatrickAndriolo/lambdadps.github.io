### What does speed has to do with the size of a Burst?

**Abstract:**  Many hope that magnetically confined tokamak plasmas can become a source of energy in the future through the fusion process. However, there is still much to be developed before that. One necessary thing is to ensure good confinement for plasmas, which is difficult due to turbulence. At the plasma edge in these devices there are coherent, high-density structures called Bursts that cause an anomalous phenomenon where we have a much greater loss of particles than expected by diffusive effects. In this presentation I will discuss the process (with an unusual use of least square method) and the results of my work where I analyzed the hypothesis to improved confinement that when breaking a burst they would travel more slowly, thus improve the confinement.

### Physics of Societies

**Abstract:** We will present the paper [Consensus Formation Times in Anisotropic Societies](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.95.062305), in which Juan Neirotti developed a statistical mechanics model to study the emergence of a consensus in societies of adapting, interacting agents constrained by a social rule B. In the mean-field approximation, we find that if the agents' interaction H0 is weak, all agents adapt to the social rule B, with which they form a consensus; however, if
the interaction is sufficiently strong, a consensus is built against the established status quo.

**Speaker:** [José Arthur de Toledo Queiroz](http://lattes.cnpq.br/5246038593368301), CCM-USP and DFGE-IFUSP

**Résumé:** Currently he is an undergraduate student in Molecular Sciences at University of São Paulo (USP) with major in Physics. He is interested in Theoretical Physics, particularly in Neural Networks, Statistical Mechanics and Information Theory, being advised by Prof. Nestor Caticha (DFGE-IFUSP) on the topic.
