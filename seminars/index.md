**Abstract:** We will present the paper [Consensus Formation Times in Anisotropic Societies](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.95.062305), in which Juan Neirotti developed a statistical mechanics model to study the emergence of a consensus in societies of adapting, interacting agents constrained by a social rule B. In the mean-field approximation, we find that if the agents' interaction H0 is weak, all agents adapt to the social rule B, with which they form a consensus; however, if
the interaction is sufficiently strong, a consensus is built against the established status quo.

**Speaker:** [José Arthur de Toledo Queiroz](http://lattes.cnpq.br/5246038593368301), CCM-USP and DFGE-IFUSP

**Résumé:** Currently he is an undergraduate student in Molecular Sciences at University of São Paulo (USP) with major in Physics. He is interested in Theoretical Physics, particularly in Neural Networks, Statistical Mechanics and Information Theory, being advised by Prof. Nestor Caticha (DFGE-IFUSP) on the topic.
